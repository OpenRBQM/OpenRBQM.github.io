# Overview

The OpenRBQM framework is designed to provide a robust and flexible solution for risk-based quality management. It includes a variety of packages that help streamline processes and ensure compliance with industry standards.

# Packages 
```{r get_packages, echo=FALSE, results = "asis"}
#| echo: false
#| warnings: false 

# Function to get package names from a GitHub repository
get_packages <- function(org) {
    url <- paste0("https://api.github.com/orgs/", org, "/repos")
    response <- GET(url)
    content <- content(response, as = "text")
    json <- fromJSON(content)
    return(json)
}

# Repositories to pull packages from
orgs <- c("openrbqm", "gilead-biostats")

# Get packages from each repository
packages <- orgs %>% map(get_packages) %>% bind_rows
   
packages %>% glue_data('- [{full_name}]({html_url}) {description}', close='\n')

```
